# Transliterate
A front end website for Transliterate.

This is just a front end web app for the Transliterate NMT Model.
It calls an API to the server for the transliteration.  

# Contribution
Anyone who are interested can send a pull request for any feature that they want.
And the API is dead simple so you can figure it out just by looking at the code.   
And try to keep up with the coding style that I used as far as applicable.
